This is a tours booking web application in which a user will find the various tours and can book these tours. A user can also filter the tours according to the statring city of tour. Every tour has reviews section, avg rating, number of ratings, destination places and the starting date. A new user first have to signup to book a tour. A user can also see his bookings in the bookings section of his account page.


The code is written in MVC architecture. The core technologies that I used are Mongo db, Node js, Express js, Mapbox and Pug as template engine.
